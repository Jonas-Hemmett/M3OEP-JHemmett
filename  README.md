## Summary
* This program manages store transactions.
* It allows for the creation and deletion of products at run time
* It allows for various items to be added to a cart
* It saves customer and transaction data to a file so they persist between runs
* It dynamically adds and removes items and transactions from memory

## Bugs
This project was sign significantly more challenging and time-consuming than I expected. Most of the features are not fully fleshed out. I have spent so much time on this but everytime I fix one issue, two more seem to pop up

Major Issues include:

* No helper function for adding customers
* No helper function for removing customers
* No helper function for adding transactions
* No helper function for removing transactions
* Settings object not fully implemented
* Input validation needs a lot more work
* Age queues should probably include iterators
* Products are only stored at runtime, they need to have a file

## Future Work

Along with fixing all the issues in the bugs section, the biggest thing is adding a basic user interface
